**This is a skeleton repo for scaffolding new Laravel packages.**

It bundles the tooling we reach for on every package: Pest, PHPStan, Rector, Laravel Pint, and Orchestra Testbench. Run the configure script once and start writing code.

### Quick start

1. Click **"Use this template"** on GitHub to create a new repository.
2. Clone your new repo locally.
3. Run the setup script:

```bash
php configure.php
```

4. Replace this README section with your own documentation.
5. Start building in `src/`.

This is where your description should go. Limit it to a paragraph or two. Consider adding a small example.

## Requirements

- PHP ^8.2
- Laravel ^10.0 || ^11.0 || ^12.0 || ^13.0

## Installation

```bash
composer require :vendor_slug/:package_slug
```

Publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=":package_slug-config"
```

## Usage

```php
$skeleton = new VendorName\Skeleton();
echo $skeleton->echoPhrase('Hello, VendorName!');
```

## Testing & Quality

The skeleton ships with a full quality toolchain. Run everything at once:

```bash
composer test
```

Or run checks individually:

```bash
composer lint        # Auto-fix code style (Rector + Pint)
composer test:lint   # Check code style without changing files
composer test:types  # Run PHPStan static analysis
composer test:unit   # Run Pest tests with coverage
```
